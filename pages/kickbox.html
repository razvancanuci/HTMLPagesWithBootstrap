    <p>Kickboxing is a group of stand-up combat sports and a form of boxing based on kicking and punching. The combat
      takes place in a boxing ring, normally with boxing gloves, mouthguards, shorts, and bare feet to favor the use of
      kicks. Kickboxing is practiced for self-defense, general fitness, or for competition. Some styles of kickboxing
      include Japanese kickboxing, French kickboxing, Chinese kickboxing and Thai kickboxing.
    <p>Although since the dawn of humanity people have faced each other in hand-to-hand combat, the first documentation
      on the use of kicking and punching in sports combat is from ancient Greece and ancient India. But nevertheless,
      the term kickboxing originated in Japan, in the 1960s, and developed in the late 1950s from karate mixed with
      boxing, with Taekwondo, Muay Thai, and Savate also having some influence, with competitions held since then.
      American kickboxing originated in the 1970s and was brought to prominence in September 1974, when the Professional
      Karate Association (PKA) held the first World Championships. Historically, kickboxing can be considered a hybrid
      martial art formed from the combination of elements of various traditional styles. </p>
    <p>This approach became increasingly popular since the 1970s, and since the 1990s, kickboxing has contributed to the
      emergence of mixed martial arts via further hybridization with ground fighting techniques from Brazilian
      jiu-jitsu, and folk wrestling.
      There is no single international governing body. International governing bodies include the World Association of
      Kickboxing Organizations (also known as WAKO), World Kickboxing Association, International Sport Karate
      Association, International Kickboxing Federation, and World Kickboxing Network, among others. Consequently, there
      is no single kickboxing world championship, and champion titles are issued by individual promotions, such as
      Glory, K-1 and ONE Championship among others. Bouts organized under different governing bodies apply different
      rules, such as allowing the use of knees or clinching, etc.</p>
    <p>The term "kickboxing" (キックボクシング, kikkubokushingu) can be used in a narrow and in a broad sense.</p>
    <ul type="bullet">
      <li>The narrow use is restricted to the styles that self-identify as kickboxing, i.e. Japanese kickboxing (with
        its spin-off styles or rules such as shootboxing and K-1), Dutch kickboxing, and American kickboxing.</li>
      <li>In the wider sense, it includes all modern stand-up combat sports that allow both punching and kicking,
        including those mentioned above, Muay Thai, Kun Khmer, Savate, Adithada, Lethwei, Sanda, and certain styles of
        karate (especially full contact karate).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Down below, there are some famous kickboxers:</p>
